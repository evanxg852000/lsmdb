# LsmDB:

Learning and building a relational database system from scratch using using Rust.




## Notes:
- I am still in early stage of my learning, so contributions will only be limited to discussions and technical design suggestions. I am all ears for anything you can teach me or anything I could do better.
- I am shooting for hight performance too, so this repo is more of an experimenting playground.
- Feel free to ask questions or open issues


TODO:
- iterators should hold onto their Arc items
- test this
